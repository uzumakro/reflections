    manually:commits have will not be to big or to small.
	the committed version should compile
	different change will be committed separately
	In other hands you might have made important change that you forget to commit,
	and by working further you make other changes that doesn't work the way you want.
	it will be hard to go back.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because some files are related and the changing one might involve changing the other too

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
